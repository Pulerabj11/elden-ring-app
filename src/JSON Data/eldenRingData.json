I am Kale, Purveyor of fine goods.\n\nAbout Kale\nI am of a nomadic people. Selling wares as I travel. The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. Let's say you're a very welcome customer.\n\nRecommendation\nYou know, if you can spare the runes, you should buy yourself a crafting kit. A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.\nI'm glady you took my warning to heart. You've made an excellent choice. (after you buy the recommendation)\n\nSmall Talk\nThere are other of my peoples who yet survive in these lands. If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.\nPerhaps you don't need to hear this, but... See that no harm comes to my kin. We have a saying, we wanderers. Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. That is our code, so to speak. Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.\n\nHowling in the Mistwood\n\"The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...I suppose he must still be skulking about...Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. \"\n\nAbout Blaidd\n\"Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.\"\n\nWhen attacked\nI knew you for a highwayman all along. Then it's time you learnt a lesson.

My apprentice...\n\nAfter you say you want to learn sorcery\nAhh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. But one must choose one's masters wisely.\nI was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?\n\nI still want to learn\nWell, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.\nAnticipate grievances, young apprentice.\n[Nod in Thought Gesture received]\n\nVisit\nYoung apprentice, first things first. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.\nSo, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. Now, shall we start learning?\n\nAfter buying some sorceries\nOur powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone, but what is the nature of such power? Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality, while Glintstone contains residual life. And thus, the vitality of the stars. It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars and the life therin.\n\nGiving her the Royal House Scroll\nOh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.\n\nWhile imprisoned at Witchbane Ruins\nIt will do no good, I swear it...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...A...argh!\n\nShow Seluvis's Letter of Introduction to Sellen\nWell, well... Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.\n\nShow Azur's sorcery\nAh, then you have seen Master Azur. Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you. You make us both proud. We can speak more later, my apprentice.\n\nTell me your story\nIf you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. No matter what we give in return. My apprentice. I presume nothing. Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. But hear me out, my apprentice. I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?\n(Let's journey together) Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. You must have a fabulous teacher.\n\nI have a favour to ask\nI need your help, my apprentice. Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.\nI need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...\n\nLead on Lusat\nAfter his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby.\n\nAfter meeting Master Lusat\nMy apprentice. Give me a moment later. I have a favour to ask.\nWho could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...You have my gratitude. This is all your work. I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.\nThis brings us a full step closer. The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. If only I could undo these wretched shackles...\n\nAbout the request\nThe form you see before you is merely a projection. My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. Can you make the journey to my body? I have something that I can only trust with you. \n\nAt Witchbane Ruins (after hearing about her request)\nMy apprentice, thank you for coming. These shackles take a toll on us all. There is something I need you to look after. My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. My self.\nThank you...my apprentice... This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.\nTreat it with care, my apprentice... What you hold is my very being...\n\nUsing Sellen's Primal Glintstone in the secret room at the Three Sisters\nMy apprentice, just how long has it been? Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. Finally, I can return to the academy. To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.\n\nChallenging Jerren\nJerren, bringer of my death.\nYou have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.\nBut I am afraid your work is done.\nJoin the school. To reflect on your mistake.\n\n After defeating Jerren\nAhh, my apprentice.\nYou've saved my skin once again.\nDo you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.\nWith the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.\nSo that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.\nMy apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?\nOh, I know it's not possible.\nYou have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.\nBut do think of me.\nOf your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.\nYou will always be my darling pupil.\nRest assured that I...\nNo, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.\nMy apprentice. Become Elden Lord.\nHmm.

The sheer terror of her...\"\n\nPrayer\n\"Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The road is yet long. A God not easily felled. But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...\"\n\nWhile caught praying\n\"Ah, You, is it? I...didn't notice you there.\nI'll be doing my job, same as ever. Just lay out your arms\".\n[About the prayer]\n\"Those words were not meant for you. I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.\nBut my prayers are mine and mine alone. Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.\"\n\nWhen asked about Roderika\n\"The girl you brought here...\nShe's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade, but she has a gift for spirit tuning.\nI saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue\".\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika\n\"The girl? What about her?\"\n[Would you watch over Roderika?] \n\"Are you out of your mind?\nWho'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?\nAbsurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it\".\n[It's what she wants]\n\"I refuse to believe it. I don't doubt you,\nbut I know when something's too good to be true\".\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika again\nI spoke with the girl. She has a gift for spirit tuning. So I told her everything I know.\nI'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. It was all I could do to honour her.\nI'm sorry I doubted you.\n\nOther\nAfter defeating Godrick, The Grafted\n\"Now, look at you. Those eyes tell a story.

It's not important.\nJust lay out your arms.\"\n\nAbout Roderika (after her dialogue about becoming a certified spirit tuner)\nThe girl has come a long way.\nAs ever, time and technique have made her stronger.

And it isn't easy.\n\nAfter refusing Melina's request at the Forge of the Giants\nAre you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?\nYour kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.\nThe demigods. And their god.\nIf you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,\nI will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.\n\nAfter the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants\nI knew you'd be back. Lay out your arms. Let's get to smithing.\nWeren't you listening? As I've always said. You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.\nAnd as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.\nIt is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika again\nI've upset the girl. She says that now my chains are broken, I'm free. That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.\nWhat use have I for freedom now? I smith weapons to slay a god. I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.\nIs there any other way?\n\nAbout the god-slaying weapon\nUse my masterpiece to slay a god. That is all that I have lived for.\nAnd my promise to Q-queen Marika. But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.\nI can't hold on much longer. I'm going the way of the R-roundtable... It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.\nAllow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends. My lord, f-for that is what you are.\n\nAfter completing Crumbling Farum Azula\nWho are you? Oh, I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing...\nCould you tell me what happened?

The Dung Eater. Again.\nI can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.\nAnd worse than ever, the reverberation of the twisted malison itself.\nBut after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.\nI can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.\"\n\nAbout the spirits' voices (after Dung Eater's quest ends and he leaves the Roundtable Hold for a second time)\n\"But it isn't like last time.\nI'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.\nDid you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?\"\n"

The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer. Let their wisdom wash over you. \"Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order. Anchor of all lands, giver of grave, wellspring of all joy. Until it was shattered. The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll. Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces. Foul curses and misery spread, unabating. But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it. So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act. Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome  shard of the Elden Ring. Seek another of its kind. To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order\". Let the words of the Fingers guide you\".\n\nWhen visiting after obtaining a Remembrance\n\"Well, well...I see...A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession. Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances. They are...valuable indeed. These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. And should you wish to wield that same power, well... I will lend you the strength of the Fingers. Heh... Do not recoil from my offer. The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?\"\n\nWhen asked about Great Runes\n\"Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished\".\n\"Listen, the Fingers speak. \"The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods. Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left.\" ...Indeed. But remember one thing. The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted\".\n\nAfter obtaining two Great Runes\n\"I had my doubts, but...my, look at you. Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.\nLook there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.\n\"Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased.

Become Elden Lord.\"\n\nWhen asked about Queen Marika\n\"Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.\nA god, in truth. But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.\nA grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood. The Fingers speak...\n\"Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence. But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel.\nConfer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort. The Fingers have willed it so\"\nNow, you may go.\"\n\nWhen visiting after obtaining the Rold Medallion\n\"Well, you managed to return.\nYou know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.\nThe Fingers remain still.\nShaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.\nWhen they are finished, the Fingers will once again offer their guidance.\nBut thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.\nNo matter for me.

Whatever will you do...\"\n\nWhen asked about burning the impenetrable thorns\n\"Heavens forbid... That is not the domain of mere men.\nThe burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.\nAnd you say you seek power of the Rune of Death, too?\nThe Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.\nThe forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation...\nUnleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...\nThe Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.\n... But here we are... The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.\nThe realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.\nWho is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?\nGo on. Finish the job. Take the course you deem most worthy.\"\n\nWhen asked how to burn thorns\n\"You must find kindling. Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants,\non the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.\nBut special kindling is required to reignite the flame.\nFor the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.\nAnd can lead you to the Rune of Death.\"\n\nAfter accessing Crumbling Farum Azula\n\"You've done it, I see.\nWhat use do you have for me, now?\nI am a Finger Reader.

He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen. However, when Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort, taking the title...of second Elden Lord. The mystery endures, to this day... As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside... and moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord\".\n\"You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret... A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature. When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet. And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too\".\n\nOn Lady Rennala:\n\"You wish to know more of Lady Rennala? She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch. Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her. And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.\"\n\"In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her. Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite; the grim art of reincarnation. You would do well to remember... Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\n\nOn Celestial Dew:\n\"Do you possess any celestial dew? Then I would like to share my knowledge with you. Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.\nRadagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew, repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala. The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.\nThis miracle blesses the church to this day. And so, you need only follow Radagon's example, to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.\"\n\nAbout the miracle\n\"To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew. Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.\"\n\nTalk\nMy faith does not waver. The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world. And this time, its bounty will not be squandered.

Their manor lies not far beyond this point. When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract. After leveling it, they carried on to the manor. The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day. That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manner. Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo. \n\nBlaidd sent me\nBlaidd actually did that, did he? Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he. Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you. At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd, I've something else that might suit you. \n\nAbout advice\nI've explained the peril. Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor. Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap. \n\nAt Ranni's Rise\nOh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. Again, I am Iji. The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray for your success. My apologies for the misleading words of warning. I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate. I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not. Do forgive me, my fellow. Let us give all that we can of ourselves. Together, for Lady Ranni. \n\nAbout Blaidd\nBlaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother. Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood. They were always happy to have me tag along, as well. When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean, Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals, but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together. Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you? The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.\n\nAbout Jerren\nJerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival. Oh, no, wait... How did I not see it before? I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight! Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars. As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line. But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars. Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. As would Lady Ranni's destiny. Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron.\n\nPlease go to the festival grounds\nGo with Blaidd to the festival grounds. Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron. \n\nAfter defeating Radahn\nAh, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything. You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all. There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgment of character. Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.\n\nAbout Jerren (after defeating Radahn)\nNow the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated... Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled. Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role. Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made. With the starts of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality... Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed...\n\nTalk (after Ranni’s quest)\nOh, there you are. Good of you to drop by. Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey. Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna’s Rise, as she calls it. It would not have been possible without you. As Lady Ranni’s war counselor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude. You, and only you, were Lady Ranni’s true champion.\nMy purpose is nearing its end. I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...It has been a long and wondrous journey. Now Lady Ranni is in your hands. I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.\n\nWhy is Blaidd in the Evergaol?\nI presume you've spoken with Blaidd? Very well. There is something you should know. The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery. But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, reists being an instrument of the Two Fingers, the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse. But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight. It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake.\n\nBlaidd’s Death\nUnthinkable, how could Blaidd… How did he break free from his cell? No, more importantly… Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet in madness, gave himself to her. I’ve made a grave misjudgement. And I thought myself a capable war counselor… I’ll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd. When I do, I only hope you’ll accept my apology.\n\nSmall Talk\nSomething else for you?\n\nWhen attacked\nAgh. Cease this treachery at once. Lady Ranni will be devastated.\n(When leaving) This is a true shame. Don't ever show your face again. Not to me. And not to my liege.\n"

      "Lore": "Introduction\nAh, nice to meet you.\nThe pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.\nI'm looking for a little something, here in the castle. When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.\nBut enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?\nThis place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...\n\nI'm here to defeat Godrick\nYou can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. Well, enjoy it while you can.\nI'm Tarnished, like you. But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.\nI'm privy to a few magical battle arts. Would you care to learn one? As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace, I'd love to help you out, if it please.\n\nAt Roundtable Hold\nAh, we meet again after all.\nI apologize for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see. So. What do you need?\n\nI've defeated Godrick\nAh, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune. Mm, looks like we both got what we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.\nWell done, friend. Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.\n[Gives you Rogier's Rapier]\nAs you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me. No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.\n\nAbout the corpse under Stormveil\nThe misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.\nIt happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.\nThat was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.\nI once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.\nThe world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights, you'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?\nAnd...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now... I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...\n\nGiving him the Black Knifeprint\nThis...is a black knifeprint! I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!\nYou recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes? They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.\nThe knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.\nPlease, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.\nThough only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death. Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...\nHalf my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.\n\nLater\nAhh, hello. I was hoping to see you.\nMy examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.\n[Gives you Black Knifeprint]\nNow, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.\nLunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.\nTruly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.\nIf Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. I would like you to procure it for me. And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.\n\nWhy do you want a cursemark?\nI'm afraid there's something I must tell you.\nDo you know of Those Who Live in Death?\nThe very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.\nBy D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.\nBut truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.\nYou may find this peculiar,\nbut I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.\nThese souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.\n\nRanni cast off her cursemark\nI see... When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.\nYou know, not everyone would trust such a tale...\nBut, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...\nThen perhaps it's true after all.\nHmm. Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...\nHow would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?\nAh, only in order to get what we want, of course.\nThe location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.\nAnd the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.\nI know you've got what it takes.\nNot only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.\n\nRogier's proposition\nCan you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?\nWhile in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.\nAnd determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.\nI realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.\nBut I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.\n\nTalk (after entering Ranni's services)\nHmm. Maybe I should tell you.\nLately, I feel I'm on the precipice...\nOf falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.\nAnd I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.\nSo I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.\nSince you're so scary and all.\n\nAbout D\nAh, so you've met D.\nD is an old friend.\nWe found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.\nBut our paths since diverged. Never again to cross.\nThough that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.\nD was telling me. That he discovered the mark of the centipede. The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark. As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature, then we may be able to form an alliance. If only I could speak to them in person. And if they were like you, all the better.\nYes, indeed.\nIf D knew what drives me now, he would surely boil over with rage.\nOr perhaps, he would even feel some pity.\nBut no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.\nI can tell a good lie when I need to.\n\nSmall Talk\nAlways good to see you safe. So. What do you need?\n\nOther\nThey were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.\nFascinating, isn't it? That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past. With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, such adaptability is more important now than ever.\n"

However...\nThe name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...\nWho exactly was Radagon?\nThe master is stumped.\nHis finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.\nCurse my mediocre mind.\nThe master only has me; and here I fail him.\n[After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]\nWhat on Earth did you do to the master?\nWell, not that I'm complaining.\nMaster's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.\nI haven't the words to thank you.\nSo I'd like to pass this on to you instead.\nA glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.\n[After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]\nTo think, that Radagon was Marika herself.\nOr at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.\nHow would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.\nSadly, I cannot comprehend it myself.\nDo you have a fuller understanding of the matter?\nWell, either way, I can continue my documentation.\nIn truth, it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not.\nI am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.\n\nAt Stargazers' Ruins Bridge:\nAh, nice to see you.\nI can't believe you've come all this way.\nI've been gripped by a terrifying thought.\nThe rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...\nbetray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.\nA conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.\nOh, but how could this be?\nI dread to even entertain the possibility...\nbut somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master.\nTell me, have I simply lost my head?\nOnly, if the master were true to the Golden Order,\nwhy would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?\nOh master, put my mind at ease.\nDispel these fearsome thoughts.\nI want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.\n[Offering the Tonic of Forgetfulness]\nIt will make me forget, you say?\nSo that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...\nHa... ha ha...\nWould that I could... Would that I could...\n[After completing Crumbling Farum Azula, if the Tonic was given]\nMaster... where did you go?\nI'm right here.\nPlease, show me. Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus...\nLet me document the motions...\nMaster... Master...\nWhere did you go?\n\n At Leyndell, Capital of Ash (if the Tonic was NOT given)\nOh, it's you.\nI've finally come to understand.\nThe master was nothing more than a madman.\nEnchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,\nseeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!\nCould there be a more pitiable comedy?\nLook at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!\nHa... ha ha ha...\n\nWhen attacked:\n(Warning) Ngh!\nWhat are you trying to achieve? Cease that!\n(Combat) You've done it now. Faith grants me strength, that I might endure. O Golden Order, shine through me.\n(On player kill) Please don't trouble us again.\n\nUpon defeat:\nO guidance...of grace... Why...can't I\n(With Goldmask) O master... To be ever at your side...\n"

Tarnished, just like you. Let me ask you something. Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight? Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm, despite the collapse of the Golden Order?\n\nIf \"My faith holds firm\" option is chosen\nYes, you're a Tarnished through and through. Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.\n\nIf \"I'm not sure\" option is chosen\nHonest to a fault, I see. Such thoughts won't behoove you as a Tarnished. But there’s nothing wrong with that. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.\n\nSmall Talk\nThere's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.\n\nOther\nNo Purchase Made: Not floating your boat, eh? Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.\nPurchase Made: Well, until we meet again.\nAfter Purchasing and selecting 'leave': Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.\n\nWhen attacked\n(Combat) I suppose I have no choice, then. Is this what grace would have of us?\n(On player kill) Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.\n\nUpon defeat\nYou are an enigma, to be certain. The Volcano Manor awaits you.\n\nAt Volcano Manor\nYou... What in heaven's name are you doing here? The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.\nI hope you understand the weight of my words.\n(I understand) Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue.\nPerhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.\nBut know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and lead only to a miserable death. Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.\n\nAfter completing one Volcano Manor quest\nSo. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt. Then I shall introduce myself once more.\nBernahl, a recusant, just like you. Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.\nWhy not add some to your repertoire?\nTo take power and make it his own, The recusant must hunt his own kind. To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging.\nWe recusants must become the most wretched of predators. All you can do is laugh.\n\nAfter completing two Volcano Manor quest\nLook at you. A recusant through and through. I knew you had it in you. Take this.\n[You receive the Letter to Bernahl]\nA special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.\nIf you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.\n\nAfter completing his quest\nAh, I had hoped you'd soon return. I have the reward from Lady Tanith.\nTake it. It's yours, by right.\nLet us tread the path of the recusant together. Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.\n\nAfter defeating Rykard\nSo. You killed Rykard? I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.\nEven he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.\nBut anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.\nWe hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.\nO Greater Will, hear my voice.

      "Lore": "Introduction\nGreetings. Traveller from beyond the fog. I Am Melina. I offer you an accord.\nHave you heard of the finger maidens? They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished. But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the Erdtree.\n\nIf Accepting\nThen its settled. Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. Ahh, another matter. I bequeath to you this ring.\n[Hands over Spectral Steed Whistle]\nUse it to traverse great distances. It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. Torrent has chosen you. Treat him with respect.\n\nIf Refusing\nI understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.\nSummon me by grace if you should reconsider.\n\nMore on Melina\nThis tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.\nBut now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.\nUpon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.\nIf the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you.\nAs an ally by pact,...I pray that you are fit... To face the challenge presented by the Ring.\n\nWhen Leveling Up\nShall I turn your runes to strength? Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.\nShare them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow.\n\nPurpose\nMe, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago, for the reason that I yet live, burned and bodyless.\nThere is something for which I must apologize. I've acted the finger maiden yet I can offer no guidance, I am no maiden.\nMy purpose was long ago lost...\n\nWhen resting at Third Church of Marika\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well. Shall I share them with you?\nVery well. In Marika's own words. My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\nWell? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.\n\nWhen resting at Church of Pilgrimage\nSpoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Makira, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you.\nIn Marika's own words.\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.\n\nWhen resting at the Grand Lift of Dectus Site of Grace\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?\nIn Marika's own words. The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nWhen resting at Altus Plateau\nThe Erdtree...is close. Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. It takes me back. I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. Where mother gave me my purpose. Though now, everything is lost to me. I...have to ascertain for myself. The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.\n\nAbout Boc\nYour seamster, Boc... I see him crying, from time to time. I think he misses his mother. He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. Does being born of a mother... Mean one behaves in such a manner?\n\nWhen resting at the Capital Outskirts\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?\nIn Marika's own words. Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved. Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God. But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken. Amounting only to sacrifices...\n\nWhen resting at the Queen's Bedchamber after defeating Morgott, the Omen King\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?\nIn Marika's own words. O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.\n\nWhen resting at Minor Erdtree Church\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?\nIn Marika's own words. I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. My comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nUpon defeating Margit, The Fell Omen, or when first resting at a non-dungeon Site of Grace outside of Limgrave (most likely trigger would be Caelid's Sellia Under-Stair, found outside of Sellia Crystal Tunnel, which is reachable through being ensnared by Dragon-Burnt Ruins' transporter trap chest)\nForgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.\nAnd...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded.\nTorrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended.\nThere is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.\nI can take you to the Roundtable Hold... Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...\nVery well. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.\n\nWhen reaching Leyndell, she can appear once you reach the East Rampart site of grace.\nMy utmost thanks. For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. Here, I can govern my own movement. And thus, the accord is fullfiled. I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. Farewell. I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. You have fought long and hard. I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.\n\nWhen being unable to enter the Erdtree, she appears at the near site of grace.\nHello again, old friend. Allow me a moment to converse with you. You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? Prevented by the mantle of barbs. The thorns are impenetrable. A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns. My purpose serves to aid in that very act. So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snow mountaintops of the giants. The I can set the Erdtree aflame. And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. (She gives the player a Rold Medallion and makes a red mark on the map.)\n\nUpon resting at the Frenzied Flame Proscription Site of Grace in the Cathedral of the Forsaken in Leyndell, Capitol of Ash\nIf you intend to claim the Frenzied Flame, I ask that you cease. It is not to be meddled with. It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair, life endures. Births continue. There is beauty in that, is there not? If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion. Please, leave the Frenzied Flame alone.\nI ask you, one more time. Please, seek not the Frenzied Flame. As one who strives to become a Lord, deny not the lives, the new births of this world. Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. When the land they preside over is lifeless.\nPlease put a stop to this madness. The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. When the land they preside over is lifeless.\n\nAfter speaking to Enia about burning the thorns\n\"Think not, of the kindling. I shall see to that.\nAll I ask of you is to make the journey.\nTo the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.\nI know... I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.\nBut it must be done to reach the path beyond.\nAnd that is the path I wish to travel.\nWhat is your mind?\"\n\nUpon resting at the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook Site of Grace\nThere is something I'd like to say. My purpose was given to me by my mother. But now, I act of my own volition.\nI have set my heart upon the world that I would have. Regardless of my mother's designs.\nI won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. Not even you.\n\nWhen resting at First Church of Marika Site of Grace\nSpoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here as well. Shall I share them with you?\nIn Marika's own words. Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance has delivered ye through ordeal to the place ye stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount. Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\nWe are almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.\n\nUpon resting at the Giants' Gravepost Site of Grace and selecting \"Talk to Melina\". Flame Peak, Mountaintops of the Giants.\nWe're almost there. The flame of ruin lies just ahead. I'm glad it was you I travelled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too. Thank you, Torrent. Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.\n\nUpon resting at the Forge of the Giants Site of Grace in Mountaintops of the Giants.\nI have long observed the Lands Between.\nThis world is in dire need ofrepair...\nand Death...indiscriminate...\nAre you prepared...\nTo commit a cardinal sin?\n(Answering \"I'd like you to wait\")\nVery well.\nTell me, when you are fully prepared.\n(Answering \"I'm Ready\")\nVery well.\nLet my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.\n(A cinematic of Melina igniting the forge)\nO Erdtree, you shall burn.\nBurn, for the sake of the new Lord.\n(Turns back at you)\nThank you. For guiding me here.\n(Lifts hand and ignites more intensly)\nThe one who walks alongside flame, \nShall one day meet the road of Destined Death.\nGood-bye.\n\nUpon resting at any Site of Grace after having inherited the Frenzied Flame\nYou... have inherited the Frenzied Flame. A pity. You are no longer fit. Our journey together ends here. And remember... Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos, I will kill you, as sure as night follows day. Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes. Goodbye, my companion. Goodbye, Torrent...\n\n\"Lord of Frenzied Flame\" ending cutscene\nLord of Frenzied Flame... I will seek you, as far as you may travel... To deliver you what is yours. Destined Death.\n"

Well Played. Though that mighty wallop of your almost spelt the end of me!\nHa ha ha ha! Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.\nI thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this\".\n[Hands over x1 Exalted Flesh]\n\"Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.\nI journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.\nBeyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.\nAnd upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.\nI'd heard whispers of such festivities before... Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!\nHa ha ha ha!\"\nI'm heading eastward. To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.\nI've heard there's to be a festival held there.\n\nEncounter at Rear Gael Tunnel Entrance, before unlocking door to Gael Tunnel\nOh I hadn't expected to see your face again.\nAre you heading to the festival of combat, too?\nOh, no need to be coy with me.\nJudging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.\nThe mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!\nNow, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.\nBut however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.\nI'm sorry to have raised your hopes.\nIt seems my calculations must have been off...\nI was created to be a warrior vessel.\nMany great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.\nIt's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.\nIt is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.\nAnd then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!\nWhat do you think, eh? How do you rate my changes?\nHeh heh...\n\nSecond encounter at Gael Tunnel, or if encountering after going through from Caelid side\n...!\nThe esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from? This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. What's going on here? A door, from thin air! Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped! Heh...heh..\nIt's time I set off. To the festival al Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!\n\nBefore fighting Radahn at Redmane Castle\nAh, you came, how delightful! Indeed, I thought I might find you here.\nBy the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held? Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!\nTo think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...\nIn truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!\nNow, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.\n\nAfter fighting Radahn at Redmane Castle\nA-ah, hello there. It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.\nI, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock. One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out.\nAfter that, I hid like a coward. And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.\n...But don't you think I've given up just yet. As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.\nIf I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.\nAnd you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.\nWho could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!\nJust you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! Just you wait, when next we meet! Heh heh...\n\nAt Liurnia of the Lakes\nAhh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole. Would you mind helping me out, again? \n(Help him) My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job! You know what to do, hm?\nGive me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.\nDon't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. I'm stuck back together good and proper! Just give it your all!\n\nReleasing him at Liurnia\nNngh! Oh, yes! That's the ticket!\nMy thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits. As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.\nDeary me, I'm oilier than a toad! There were countless oil jars back where I'm from actually.\nAnd now I know what it's like to be one of them! Heh heh...\nYes, indeed, I too have a home. Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.\nSo, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...\nPow!

Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?\nCome and tell me when you're ready. I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.\nYou are ready then, I take it? Then let us begin! I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! Lend me strength, O warriors within! Let us become one champion, together!\n\nAfter winning the duel\nAs I suspected... Victory... was impossible. This vessel... was found lacking...\nMy thanks, I knew you were the stuff of champions. It was a marvellous battle.\nI implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me...

Varré. Take care to listen.\nAre you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.\nYou may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.\nThat is the guidance of grace.

Grace's guidance holds the answers.\nIt will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.\nEven if it leads you to your grave.\nGrace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.\nTo Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.\nThe home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.\nIt's time you set off, I should think.\nTo Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.\nIf you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.\n\nIf attacked\nOh?\nDo you even comprehend the gravity of this choice?\nVery well.

To the famed Roundtable Keep...\n\nAfter defeating Margit, The Fell Omen and accessing to Roundtable Hold\nOhh, well done, well done indeed. You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.\nAnd off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold... My sincerest congratulations.\nBut, how did you find the Roundtable? Oh, you don't have to say it.\nBefore, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.\nI fear you've been terribly disappointed. I don't blame you.\nBut still, the Roundtable has its perks. Why not earn a seat?\nFly straight and true, so to speak.\n\nChoosing \"I'll fly straight and true!\"\n Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.\nTo join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune,\nand request audience... with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.\nThey are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.\nMm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.\nChallenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.\nDecrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains.

Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. That's the part that irks the most.\n\nChoosing \"They were magnificent\"\nYou don't say. Well, what a relief that must be. You may go, then.

Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers. But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.\n\nChoosing \"Refuse.\"\nOh my. Perhaps you misheard me. Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two. For your ears to clear out.\n\nAfter returning with the blood-soaked Favor.\nAhh, my lambkin. You've completed your final trial. And with this, you are a formal inductee. A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty. Now, give me your finger. This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you.\nOh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.\nNever forget that feeling of agony. For it is what binds you to Luminary Mogh, to all of us. Ha ha ha...

I knew I saw something in you. I shall await you at my fort. We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think. I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.\"\n\nAt Fort Haight\n\"Ah, you, is it? I suppose you must have seen by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort? Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler. One must be found, with haste. And not that Awful Godrick. But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. I am sorry for have lifted your hopes... But I haven't the authority to raise you to the knighthood as things stand. The Great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology. But now, I must begin my search post-haste. For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.\"\n\nAt Stormveil Castle throne room (after Nepheli Loux has been given Stormhawk King)\nAh, nice to see you after so long. Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good. Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler. Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage. Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less. For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards. At which time I can fulfil my old promise. By raising you to the glory of knighthood. I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.\n"

You must be new here. I'm... \nWell, just call me Diallos.\nThe honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.\nBy the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?\nShe's my servant, but fickle as the wind.\nTake your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.\nIf you find her, please be sure to tell me.\nBe sure to tell me If you meet a young woman named Lanya.\nShe's a servant to my house. She's been my companion since childhood.\nI've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.\nHonestly, she's such a little tomboy.\n\nAt Academy Gate Town\nLanya... Lanya... It's me Diallos. Answer me, would you?\nHello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.\nThe whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.\nThe recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.\nThey laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.\n\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\"\nI, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.\nThey laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.\n\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\"\nI, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.\n\nAt the Roundtable Hold\nAh, you again is it? The recusants sent a lackey.\nCan you believe they invited me to join them? Now! After what they did...\nI can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?\nYou might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.\nThen I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.\nIt's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills.\nThat's where they hide. The manor on the peak.\nJust you wait, wretched recusants.\nYou'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya.\n\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all.\n\nAt Volcano Manor\nAh. Oh... I-it's you is it? Well. Nice to see you again.\nSo you've been invited as well, I see.\nThen we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?\nI, um... I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... Well, you see, I...\nAfter much internal debate. I've come to realise... Revenge is not the answer\nAccording to Lady Tanith... I've got the stuff of champions.\nAnd champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced walk a tainted a path.\nIt hit me like a bolt from the blue... That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.\nOf course, my heart weeps for Lanya. That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.\nBut succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it.\nLanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.\nBut such is true of any road trod by champions.\nI always resented these hands.\nTheir pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.\nBut that won't be the case for long.\nThey'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.\n\"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all.\n\nAfter doing the Volcano Manor questline\nIt's just as my noble brother says. I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion.\nAh, it's you is it. I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself.\nI haven't achieved anything at all thus far. Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.\nI'm still yet to achieve anything. Perhaps I am a fool after all...\nNo. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.\nWhat an easy mark I must have been... How did it take me so long to realise, honestly.\nThere's just no end to my foolishness, is there...\n\nJarburg\n(Overheard talking to NPC jar) Well. Aren't you full of beans. No wonder you're covered in muck.\nOh? My friend, it's been far too long. I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. But... as you can see, I've put all that behind me. Left the Volcano Manoor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices. Even a fool like me can look after some simply jars. Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.\n\nAfter Jarburg is attacked\n...Ah, you... Are the jars... they alright? Did I defend them?\n(\"You defended them\") \nThen all is well... This fool proved his worth, in the end...\n(“I'm afraid not\") \nHa ha...ha... I see... I see... I've been a fool... to the last...\n\nWhen attacked at Academy Gate Town\n(Warning)\nAgh! What on earth was that for?\n(Combat)\nNow I see. You're a wretched recusant! May you rue the day that you thought to trample me! The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!\n(On player kill)\nLanya, your honour has been restored. You can rest easy.\n\nWhen attacked at Jarburg\n(Warning)\nUgh! What's the matter? Please, stop! I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor. I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!\n(Combat)\nWhy on earth...? Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you? I'll turn my back on duty no more. The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!\n(On player kill)\nUnharmed, thank the stars.\n\nWhen defeated\n(At Academy Gate Town)\nHa ha...ha... I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...\n(In Jarburg)\nAhhh, just what I deserve...

Cough up your coin, all of it!\n\nDuring fight\nSurrendering: Wait, wait, please! I surrender! White flag and all! Well, finally come around, have you?\nAttacking during his surrender: For Pete's Sake! I concede! No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know! I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man!\nContinuing to attack after his surrender: Cripes, are you dense, boy? Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!\nDeath: Well... It was bound to happen some day... What a **** show...\nPlayer kill: There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.\n\nAfter fight\nWell, finally come around, have you? I knew you would. You're a lady/gentleman of reason, through-and-through. Ha ha ha...\nAH...Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me. Now, how did I get that wrong? I took you for a demi-human, or some such. An innocent mistake, I assure you. Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on? (You can select two options \"Forgive and Forget\" or \"Some things can't be forgiven\")\n\nIf forgive and forget is chosen\nA true lady of reason. Just what I like about you. I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered. Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say. Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel. In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes. But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying. Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. So, don't be a stranger, eh? I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time. Ha ha ha...\n\nIf some things can't be forgiven is chosen\nWhat's the matter? This simply isn't like you. \n\nDropping by\nWell, nice of you to drop in, finally. It's a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something. And welcome to Patches' Emporium. Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.\n\nAsk about the bandits\nYeah, I had those bandits make a clean break. Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that. I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying, but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection. They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army. Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty- lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish... It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.\n\nThat chest…\nHm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest? Well, it's uh, nothing too special. Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.\nOther\nDon't forget to pop back for another visit, friend. I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.\n\nSecond visit without opening chest\nBe the way, friend...\nYou've really been there for me, through thick and thin.\nAnd so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.\nAn extra special thanks, to an extra-special customer.\n\nWwhat you spoke of before\nWhat's wrong? I've made up my mind. The chest is yours, in word and deed. Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold. But a Patches' promise? Well, that's priceless!\n\nWhen you come back alive after being transported\nAh, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm? But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience. At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!\n\nAfter moving to Liurnia\nOh, well! It's been a long while. It's me. Patches the Untethered. I'm still in business, if you can believe it. Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch. Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria. By the way, have you met that girl Rya? She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help. Not that it's any of my business, but...If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear? \n\nTalking in Liurnia\nYou're...making your way to the Erdtree, no? Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination. Have you ever seen an iron virgin? The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition. And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Its transpositional powers fully intact. So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...It'll chuck you straight at the base of the Erdtree...Or so I'm told...Ha ha...ha ha...\n\nAttacking outside of the boss fight\nWhat are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!\nWhat's wrong with you? It's me, Patches. Patches! Enough now, stop!\nProvoked: Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we? Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming! Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!\nSometime after being provoked: Last chance to surrender, mate. Grovel, and I'll forgive you!\n[Teaches you the Grovel gesture]\nAfter groveling: ...Okay, I can see you mean it. Consider it water under the bridge. A momentary lapse of judgement, all's well, as you know.\nPlayer kill: Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.\n\nCutscene after following the rainbow stones referenced in his message in Mt. Gelmir\nWell, if you really are that gullible... then stay away from the Volcano Manor! Bye now! Take care!\n\nAfter joining the Volcano Manor\nWell, you've joined the Manor eh? I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.\nAll good, though. We're on the same side, now. We'll do good work together.\nOh, and of course, we can do business, if you like. Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specifically for you.\n\nAbout Patches\nAre you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.\nI always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers. I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.\nNot to mention Tanith has always made me curious. I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.\nEven after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud. I've never seen a woman quite like her...\n\nAfter completing one Volcano Manor quest\n Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing. This is for you.\n[Gives Letter to Patches]\nYou're new here at the Manor. But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.\nRelax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right? Go on, break a leg, then. Heh heh...\n\nAfter completing his quest\nYou hunted down Tragoth? Are you certain? No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.\nI'll give Tanith the news. Have some rest, by all means.\n\nWhat is my reward?\nHmph. Sharper than you seem, aren't you... I was just holding onto it for you, you know.\nHere you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.\n[Gives Magma Whip Candlestick]\n\nAfter defeating Rykard\nNow you've gone and killed Rykard? You scheming little bastard.\nCripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical... Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...\nBut for  now, this Manor is finished. The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.\nA fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.\nHeh heh...ha ha... Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.\nGood-bye, my friend.\n\nAt the shaded castle\nAh, oh, you again... A shame you had to see me like this...\nOhh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all. I should've stuck to what I know best.\nNo matter. I know I-I can trust you. Gullible, yes, but a good soul.\nMake certain that Tanith gets this.\n[Gives Dancer's Castanets]\nOh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape.\nC'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.\nYou're able then? Then I can rest easy, my friend...\n\nOpening his chest in Murkwater Cave after giving the castanets to Tanith\nWell, well, well? Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?\nYou scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!\nCough up your coin, all of it!\nHm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you? Oh, cripes, please, wait! I surrender! I surrender, I swear!\n(If you continue attacking him)\nDo you even hear me? I said \"surrender\", loud and clear\"! No one likes a bull-headed brute!\nYou'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?\nCripes! Are you dense, mate? What in the world has gotten into you?\nFine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!\n\nAfter letting him surrender\nWell, glad to see we're on the same page. I'd never cross you, not even close.\nAh... It's been ages since I've seen you. I didn't even realise it was you.\nTook you for a demi-human, or some such. You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.\nWater under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?\nHell's bells... This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...\nEspecially if we keep running into the likes of you ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...\n"

      "Lore": "Introduction\nOh, this is a rare occasion. I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.\nVery well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard.\nAllow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.\nA house guest, yet to earn their keep. Remember your place, newcomer.\nThere's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.\n\nNext visit after introduction\n\"What do you need? I have little time to spare\".\n[What do you mean, a house guest?]\n\"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?\nThen you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.\nStand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.\nIf those words held any meaning to you...\nFollow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.\nDo so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.\nAnd you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.\n\"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.\nAs a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you\".\nI'm sick and tired of them. These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...\n\"We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to\".\n\nAfter speaking to Enia\nYou've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? Then, just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. I am known as Gideon Ofnir. As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.\n\nVisit\nYou'll be after more Great Runes, now eh? Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge. The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers. We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.\n... You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?\n\nAbout Godrick\nSo. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest, but I suspect you know that well enough already.\n\nAbout Radahn\nGeneral Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...\n\nAbout Rykard\nPraetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. Rykard has commited the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.\n\nAbout Morgott\nMorgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.\n\nAbout Rennala and The Academy of Raya Lucaria\nThe Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. But Rennala herself is no demigod. Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. The Great Rune dwells withing the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.\n\nAbout Nepheli\nI understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. She is my daughter. I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. Tough a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. So I put her to work. Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. \n[After beating the Omenkiller in Albinauric Village] Ahh, you've already heard? Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. So I have no further use for her. Honestly, what's a man to do. A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. I suspect... that's just what the Queen wants. A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.\n\nShowing Seluvis's Potion\nIs that potion what I think it is? Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.\nOh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. The Roundtable has no code to speak of. \nBut, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?\nOr would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?\n[Hand over Seluvis's Potion] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.\nJust tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.\nDespite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.\nHis inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.\n[Don't hand it over] Well, I won't force you. But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. She's not herself right now, and though I have no need for her, she still has potential. Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.\n\nAfter defeating Ensha\nOh, my apologies for that nasty business. Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. As his master, I'd like to express my regret. But now, Ensha is slain and gone. Finished, forever more. \nAh, yes, by way of apology, allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. Find the Albinauric woman. She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia. She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.\n\nAfter defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon\nWell. I see you've found another Great Rune. Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.\nMake the journey. To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.\nThe Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.\nFor we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.\n\nAfter defeating Morgott, the Omen King\nWhere should I go?\n\"If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.\nYou'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.\nGo, if you would. Take no heed of \"cardinal sin\".\nThe Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.\"\n\nUnlocated demigods\n\"There are four more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. If you should learn anything of these matters, I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.\"\n\nAfter Nepheli Loux leaves for Stormveil Castle Throne Room\nI hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.\nThough I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.\nSorry. For the time you had to waste.\n\nAfter reaching Consecrated Snowfield\nAhh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.\nI'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.\nYou've made more of yourself than Ensha has...\nNow, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.\nI suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?\nMe too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.\n\nAfter reaching Miquella's Haligtree\nAhh, so the secret medallion led you to the land of the Haligtree?\nI'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.\nWell, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.\nBut...with the Haligtree as it is... I suppose Miquella must already be...\nAh, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.\nThe information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:\nA secret rite known only to me.\nYou are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.\n[Gives Black Flame's Protection]\n\nAfter defeating Malenia, Blade of Miquella\nSo. The Haligtree, now but a husk... I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,\nbut before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.\nIndeed, it seems those words held weight. How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...\nPerhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified... Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.\nThe information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:\nA secret rite known only to me.\nYou are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.\n[Gives Lord's Divine Fortification]\n\nAfter reaching Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum\nOh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.\nA fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.\nLet him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as the are - distant and unattainable.\nBut perhaps it's worth looking into... If what I've heard is right, then maybe...\nAh, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.\nThe information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:\nA secret rite known only to me.\nYou are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.\n[Gives Fevor's Cookbook (3)]\n\nAfter defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood\nAhh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all! That is some fine intelligence indeed!\nWith it, the final clue has been brought into the light.\nOne of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.\nAs promised, allow me to impart to you the last of the secret rites known only to me.\n[Gives Law of Causality]\nWell I wonder what comes next...\nIf he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all will be well.\nBut perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.\nMiquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...\n\nAfter the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants\nYou...burned the Erdtree, didn't you? Then the Roundtable is soon to follow. Ah, no need to fret about that.\nThe Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.\nAnd if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen, then the Roundtable must go as well.\nI'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.\nI must learn all that can be taken from this place, and sear it into my memory.\nHow could I call myself the All-Knowing if I did any less?\nThe pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.\nThus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.\nPerhaps the same could be said about guidance.\nWho's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?\nWhat do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?\n"

      "Lore": "Introduction\nAren't you precocious. We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation. Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago...So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts? About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? If you have,  why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us? Rise with us, against the Erdtree.\n\nIntroduction after journeying with Rya\nBrave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor. I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. Rya spoke well of you. \"A warrior of promise\", I believe she said. Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment. Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide? Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers? Rise with us, against the Erdtree. \n\nJoin Volcano Manor\nYour decision is most welcome. Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you. (Gives the Drawing-Room Key)\n\nAfter you read the letter\nDid you read the letter left for you? That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it. But you must leave this house at once. This is a war against the Erdtree. We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands. \n\nAfter completing the first quest\nYou've completed your task. I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. This is your reward as promised. (Gives Magma Shot). Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion. The way is tainted, but for this very reason, it is the true path to valour.\n\nAfter completing the second quest\nI see you've performed another task for us. Here is your usual reward. Please, take it. (Gives Serpentbone Blade). Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you. Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard. The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace. But it was all too meagre, in the fate of the enormity of their task. The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs. Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering. Our Lord, indignant, had refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us. If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy. We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done. If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle. I cannot come a day too soon!\n\nAfter completing the third quest\nI see that you've stayed the path of champions. This is your usual reward. Please, take it. (Gives Taker's Cameo). Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord? Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.\n(See the Lord) Now, close your eyes for a moment. I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.\nFarewell, then. May your visit be fruitful.\n\nAfter defeating Rykard\nYou... It's true then. You've defeated out Lord. No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that. Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger. Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part. \nI will leave the Volcano Manor before long. I suggest you do the same. I will miss these encounters. The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more. I always was an admirer.\nThis is farewell. Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.\n\nZorayas's Form\nDid you see her? The girl, Rya... with her true face... Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas, then perhaps it is not my place to speak. But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you. Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas. Her true visage belies the purity of her heart... Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.\n\nZorayas's troubles\nI should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough. Well, Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you. That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage. Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself. What matters one's lineage in such a crisis.\n\nZorayas's absence\nAnd she has no scouting duties now. Has she gone off in search of answers? Why won't she just listen...\nMay I ask your aid? Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother. If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress, have her drink this potion. To purge that which would cause her pain. (Gives Tonic of Forgetfulness). Yes, I know. My wish is a grave disrespect to her. No different than the Erdtree's impostion. But I've no choice... It must be done.\n\nAfter giving Rya the tonic\nI will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail. Our Lord must have known this all along. My meekness is all too clear...\nSweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?\n\nAfter killing Rya\nMy gratitude for your forthrightness. If you would...allow me some time alone.\n\nWhen you find her eating off Rykard's corpse\nOh, you... Allow me some time. Our lord's carcass is vast and not easily consumed. Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, I wish to be your serpent; your family. One day, let us devour the gods together.\n(Gives the Dancer's Castanets) What is it? I have no need of that. I must continue devouring my beloved lord.\n"

Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor.\nUnder Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.\n\nAfter completing the first Volcano Manor quest\nHave you ever...heard any strange sounds here at the manor?\nSomething beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...\nOh fie what am I saying? It just isn't possible. I must be tired.\nSometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. Like breathing, or slithering scales.\nOh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.\n\nAfter completing the second Volcano Manor quest\nBrave Tarnished, what is your business here? I'm afraid this is not a guest room.\nWhat's that peculiar look upon your face?\nGoodness, am I still a serpent? Oh, how dreadful... How dreadful indeed...\nForgive my distress. I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.\nBrave Tarnished. This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.\nPlease forgive the deception. Do understand. The duplicity is my own doing.\nLady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.\nLady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.\nThat my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. I am proud of what I am.\nBut people are cruel. If they saw my true form, the wouldn't speak to me.\nAnd so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.\nBut you are not like the rest. \nMy serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.\nNow I share the secrets with you, as well. Please keep them safe from anyone else.\n\nAfter speaking to Tanith and reloading the area\nUm, oh, it's you. Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. Hmm, well... I know I can trust you...\nI saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.\nIf I'm not mistaken, it took the form of a serpent, just like me...\nDoes the Volcano Manor hide some secret, that Lady Tanith has kept from me?\nI realise that I shouldn't impose but, if you discover anything, would you please share?\n\nTell her of the dark side of Volcano Manor\nReally... Oh, so there was a secret after all... Oh my...\nLady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...\nWas I not... born by the grace of a king?\n\nGiving her the Serpent's Amnion\nI remember this scent, distinctly.

As I had hoped.\nI was entrusted this, for thee.\nBy Torrent's former master.\n'Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.\nSummon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.\nThe spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.\nNow it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.\nForgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.\nI doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.\nHow long will it be, I wonder...\nBefore the Tarnished tire of obesiance to the Two Fingers?\n\nUpon defeating Rennala's first phase in Raya Lucaria Academy\nUpon my name as Ranni the Witch.\nMother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee.\nFoul trespasser.\nSend word far and wide.\nOf the last Queen of Caria, Rennala of the Full Moon.\nAnd the majesty of the night she conjureth.\n\nMeeting at Ranni's Rise \nOh, again we cross paths.\nI believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.\nIt pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...\nBut Tarnished, what business hast thou here?\nI have no memory of inking thee an invitation.\n\nYou must be Ranni the Witch, behind the Night of the Black Knives\nI see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.\nIndeed, I am the witch Ranni.\nI stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.\nI did it all.\nBut sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.\nI have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.\nAnd it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.\n\nWhere did the body go?\nAnd why should I reveal that to thee?\nI performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,\nBut all the same, the begging compels me not a jot.\nThe cursermark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.\nNow, begone.\n\nI wish to serve you\nOh, is that so?\nThou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?\nAffording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?\nVery well...\nThere's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.\nWhat's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,\nI am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...\nI'll allow it. Enter my service.\nAnd good hunting to thee.\nGood, then I ask we proceed with haste.\nThere is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.\nI would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.\nI have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.\nAh, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.\nHeed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.\nI am sure the others will be doing just the same.\nSpeak with the three who await thee below.\nThou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.\nIt hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.\nAh, allow me to forewarn thee.\nI shall soon enter my slumber.\nAnd it will be some time before I wake.\nThis doll's body is not without its hindrances...\nStill, I have high hopes for thee.\nI look forward to the good news when I arise.\n\nNo particular reason\nNo reason in particular, thou claimest?\nIntriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.\nWilt thou enter into my service?\nI am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.\nThat I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.\nWell? Has that roused thy interest?\n\nServe Ranni the Witch\nThou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.\nBut I require as much of those under my command.\nI anticipate good work from thee.\n[same as \"I wish to serve you\"]\n\nWhen attacked\nWhat hopest thou to profit?\nTo think such was thy plot. Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies. I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.\n\nAdminister Amber Draught (Seluvis' quest)\nWell, this is a most unpleasant awakening.\nThe depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.\nI am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.\nLed astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand.\nDidst thou think to have thy way with me?\nBe gone. Hapless scum.\nI won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.\nI have spoken. Away from my sight.\nThis is the third time, fiend.\nEnough of thy unbearable breath.\n\nGiving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade\nAhh...It was thee. Not Blaidd, it seemeth. Even in my slumber, I sensed it.\nIt is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?\nMy thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.\nSoon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.\nAh, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.\nMy thanks, for thy sterling efforts.\nA strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.\nI am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.\nI must thank Torrent too, for his part.\nYou may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.\nWhat is it? You may go.\nI, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.\n\nWhen speaking to Miniature Ranni at the Ainsel River Main Site of Grace\nOh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?\nOr is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?\nFine...fine.\nI hadn't expected any soul to recognize me in this guise.\nBut now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.\nPerform for me a service, as recompense.\nEliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.\nThe name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.\nI will not brook disobedience in this matter.\nLet us speak of the past, a while.\nI was once an Empyrean.\nOf the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.\nEach of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.\nBut I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.\nI stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.\nI would not be controlled by that thing.\nThe Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... And the Baleful Shadows... are their assassins.\nI turned my back on the Two Fingers and we each have been cursing the other since. The Baleful Shadows... are their assassins.\n\nWhen speaking to Ranni at the Nokstella Waterfall Basin Site of Grace\nEven when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.\nBlaidd remained my loyal ally.\nHeh. Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,\nHe was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.\nBlaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.\nYet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...\nThat I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.\nAh, should I add thee to the list?\nAnother one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.\nAch, this form hath loosened my tongue.\nI've let slip too much.\nForget what thou'st heard. Forget.\n\nAfter using the Dark Moon Ring\nSo, it was thee, who would become my Lord.\nPerhaps I needn't have warned thee.\nI am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.\nI go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.\nI bid thee travel the path of the Lord.\nAnd once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.\n\nAttacking her after using the Dark Moon Ring\nWhat hopest thou to profit?\nHmph. So, this is the measure of my Lord? Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve. ...For surrendering myself to delusion.\n\nUpon speaking to Miniature Ranni at her chambers Site of Grace after finishing her questline.\nI take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised.\nI thought I might expound a little further... Upon the order I envision.\nMine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.\nI would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at great remove.\nAnd have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch... All become impossibilities.\nWhich is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.\nWouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only lord?\n\n\"Age of Stars\" ending cutscene.\n...The battle is over, I see.\nTo every living being, and every living soul.\nNow cometh the age of the stars. A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon\nHere beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond. Into fear, doubt, and loneliness... As the path stretcheth into darkness.\nWell then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal.\n"

Is that a scroll?\nI won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...\nYou're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.\nSo, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.\nThat said, don't you dare get your hopes up.\nMore often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect...\n...upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.\n\nAbout Nepheli:\nSo, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?\nHmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.\nIt's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.\nI may have expected too much of her, to begin with.\n\nAbout your chambers:\nYou break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?\nYour oafishness knows no bounds.\nFine and well.\nYou tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.\nI believe that makes you my accomplice.\nYou yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?\nWell, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.\nBut perhaps I can make a very special exception.\nNow, choose.\n[Offers choice between Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet and Jarwight Puppet]\n(Upon returning) How's the puppet I gave you?

And he'll be sure to treat you right. I owe you one, I reckon.\nThat's enough chit-chat for now. It's time we parted ways.\n\nIn spectral form, after meeting Ranni at Ranni’s Rise\nAhh, long time, friend. Blaidd, if you’ve forgotten. Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni. \nWell. Getting right to business… I’m still in Limgrave. The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land. I’m planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood. See if I can’t find the road to Nokron from there…\n\nUpon meeting him at Siofra River\nAh, good to see you. Apologies mate, but I don’t have much to report. I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I’m absolutely stumped. I’ve tried all the gateways, to no avail… Perhaps it’s time to ask Seluvis? I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something… Let’s give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are…\nI jest, I wouldn’t go that far. Besides, I should check on some things here. Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source. Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.\n\nSecond meeting at Siofra River, after talking to Sorceress Sellen\nAh. Well met. What news?\n\nAfter selecting “Tell Sellen’s story” dialogue option.\nHmm… So Ranni’s fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn… That reminds me of something I heard. There’s a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave. It’s a festival of combat. And I heard… that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods… Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but I think it’s worth investigating. I’ll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then…\nYou’re coming too, right? To Radahn’s festivities… I’ll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid. The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.\n\nAfter selecting “Don’t say anything” dialogue option.\n???\n\nAt Redmane Castle before the festival of Radahn begins\nAh, there you are. Took your sweet time. The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain… Let’s give them a show to remember, eh. Just don’t you go dying on me. For Ranni’s sake, too.\n\nAfter defeating Radahn\nAh, good. I was waiting for you. What a sick way to fight, eh. The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. And hah! Did you see that, afterwards? A falling star, right before our eyes! I can’t fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. And, the path has now been cleared. To Nokron, where Ranni’s fate will be decided. Let’s meet where the falling star bit the earth. We’ll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni. \nLet’s meet where the falling star bit the earth. And we’ll go into battle again, side by side. My only purpose is to fight for Ranni’s fate, sword and fang. The curtain’s rising… on the final act.\n\nBlaidd’s message left at Mistwood Ruins (before the player enters Nokron)\nThere’s a traitor taken care of. Onwards to Nokron, then. Go on, I’ll catch up.\n\nAt Forlorn Hound Evergaol after defeating Radahn\nOh, it's you... It's me, Blaidd. Old Iji trapped me here. Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni. But there's no chance that could happen. I'm part of her being. Her very shadow... I thought old Iji knew as much... Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...\n[Open the evergaol]\nMy thanks, friend. I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now. I don't know what came over old Iji, but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.

As promised I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. Go on, its yours. Now, let me have a look at the needle. \nThe needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness I'm sure. Will you give it to the girl, Millicent? I will reward you in kind. Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder. Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god. A wretched fate indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this. \nDo you find it peculiar? That I would show such concern for the girl? Well, I'm the one who found her. A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. She is one of my dear daughters. But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory. I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much. \n\nAfter Millicent has visited and left Gowry's Shack\nOh, you noticed, did you?\nIndeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.\nIt seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.\nHowever, she has no need of me, any more.\nNo, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.\nAs I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...\nIs to be forgotten.\nPlease make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.\nLike her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,\nbut commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.\n\nAfter giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis\nThis is a wonderful development. Thank you for your kindness. Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. Like her beautiful mother.\nGreen and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence. What a wondrous day that will be. In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. She might very well outshine her sisters.\n\nAfter giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis and purchasing the Pest Threads incantation\nDo you have an interest in rot incantations? Then you might like to learn something of the history...of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.\n\"Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.\nShe was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.\nAn Empyrean...is no mere demigod.\nIn the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.\nSince Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.\nAnd to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.\"\n\nAfter speaking to Millicent at the Prayer Room Site of Grace\nThe words of a true innocent, the dear girl. Well, perhaps this is just as it should be. Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what. This is their fate, after all.\n\nOnce you have the choice to help or invade Millicent:\n[Why are you crying?] \"Oh it's just...\nI realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and...\nMy eyes began to well...\nShe is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.\nAnd when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.\"\n[Become a flower? (1)] \"Which is why...\nIf you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,\nI ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.\nIt must be done by your hand; no other.\nMillicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.\nSever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.\nWhen Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.\nAs a scarlet valkyrie.\"\n[Become a flower? (2)] \"You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.\nThe superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?\nI beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.\"\n\nOther\n\"We shall meet again, you and I. There are countless pests to choose from.\" (First time killing Gowry)\n\"We shall meet again. As many times as it takes. For you to understand.\" (Subsequent killing at Gowry's Shack after the first)\n\"Have you taken the lesson, now? Killing me is an exercise in futility. All is well, provided you understand. Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?\" (Dialogue after talking to him at Gowry's Shack after he has respawned)\n\nAfter assisting Millicent and her quest ends\nMillicent, my daughter. Why would you take out the needle? You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers. Would you disown us too? As your Mother did? We children of the scarlet rot?\nMillicent... Malenia... Do you detest us, so utterly?\n\nAfter killing Millicent at the Church of Plague\n\"O Millicent, my daughter... Who would prune your sapling flesh?\nSuch...such cruel and vulgar violence...\"\n\"O Millicent... My most promising little bud...\"\n"

My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.\n\nUpon giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle\nYou ask that I stab myself with the needle... To quell the scarlet rot? But...how? ... Never mind. I've decided. I would rather trust you, than simply continue to spoil from within. Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment? Well. That was easier than expected. But...why do I feel so...\n\nUpon reloading area\nI...hoped to see you again. My apologies for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you. Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. Even the nightmares have abated... And now, thought I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please. It is all thanks to you. Not that I could every truly repay you, but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is. \n\nAttacking her after giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle\n(Warning) Ugh. Is there something wrong? Please, cease this at once.\n(Combat) Why are you doing this? Now you've forced my hand.\n(On player kill) I will not forget what you did for me. But this day marks our farewell.\n\nAfter receiving the Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom\nI'm considering leaving. On a journey. With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... My destiny... My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.\n\nAt Gowry's Shack\nOh, hello again. Something about this place felt familiar to me. So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here. But I've only found emptiness. Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to. I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.\nI must stay strong. I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.\n\nNorth of the Erdtree-Gazing Hill Grace on the Altus Plateau\nAh. We meet again. In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me. The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met. As such, I've been able to continue my journey. I realise that if I still had my sword arm, I could have aided you in battle.\nNow, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds. I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. I think she's in the north. In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.\n\nAfter giving her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis\nGiving me this arm? I thank you. I am in your debt, yet again. I think, if the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again.\nIf the arm serves well enough, it might be possible for me to wield a sword again. Perhaps, then. I can aid you in battle.\n\nNear the Windmill Heights Grace on the Altus Plateau \nAh, we meet yet again. The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. It is the only way that I can express my thanks.\n\nNear the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Grace at Mountaintops of the Giants\nTo think we'd meet in such a place... What could your purpose possibly... No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me. Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.\nI'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.\n\nNear the Prayer Room Grace at Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree\nAgain we meet. I can only surmise our purposes are aligned. In which case, allow me to explain myself. I am of Malenia's blood. But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot... Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.\nThere is something I must return to Malenia. The will that was once her own. The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.\n\nAfter choosing to help Millicent at the end of her questline, laying by the pool near where her summoning sign was\nThank you for lending your hand. Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet. I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.  Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.\nBut this is where things end. I pause to even tell you, but... I took out the needle myself. Tell whoever put you up to this. That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.\nPlease, let me pass alone. The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever. Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. Curse-laden. Untouchable. I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.\n\nKilling Millicent at the end of her questline in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree before reloading the area\nI did not expect it to end like this. But I will not forget what you have done.\n\nAfter choosing to challenge Millicent\nAhh, how could you... Is this your true heart? Was I... was it all...for this?\n"

I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate. A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn, the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.\n[I'm not the festive type] Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum? No matter. One day you will see. That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. \n[About Iji] Well, I haven't heard that name in an age. Then you must serve Princess Ranni? The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this: The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate into motion. By the by... Is that old fool still hammering out weapons? His enormous frame, cramped in that little place... Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him. And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone.

Brave champion you have our gratitude. The Celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased.

Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour... He says he isn't a warrior. And since he's a coward he won't be fighting anymore. His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us. But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.\n\nAfter Diallos arrives at Jarburg (while sleeping)\n... They're wonderful, Diallos. So smooth, and silky... ...\n\nAfter Jarburg is attacked\nO-oh! Coz! I'm glad you came. But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher. Though quite a lot of us got broken... I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior. \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\"  That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz. Even if I'm scared, I'll still fight to protect everyone.\n\nAfter completing Iron Fist Alexander's questline\nThanks for coming back, coz. I've been thinking. It's time for me to set out on a journey. As a warrior jar, upon the path of champions.\n(If player chooses to 'Give Alexander's Insides') Wow, coz, are these... Insides? From Uncle Alexander? ... Thank you, coz. I'm a warrior jar, so I need to be strong. I can really have them, right? I understand. I'll get strong. Strong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides.\nI don't think I'll see you again, when I set out. Warriors are supposed to work alone. Goodbye, coz. And thanks for everything. I'll never forget you, coz. \n\nWhen attacked\nOh? What's the matter, coz? Don't be such a nasty brute.\n\nUpon Death\n...So, this is who you are, coz... You've cracked my heart. Please, don't crack the others...\nSo, you were a poacher, too. But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood. I'll find you, one day, coz...\n"
